{:.intro}
The Design Patterns section is split into two areas, broadly organised according to the main task they are supposed to help with. 

<ul>
 <li>If you're doing design then you'll probably find the Detail and Process patterns (below) most useful; they're mostly about which patterns to use and why we're recommending them.</li>
 <li>If you're doing development then you'll probably find [the GOV.UK elements](/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/elements)  most useful; they're mostly about how to make your service look consistent with GOV.UK and include links to code snippets. </li>
</ul>

Whatever you're doing, you'll need to use these patterns as part of a user-centred design approach.

### Detail patterns
These patterns bring together our approach to selected details of services, transactions, and forms.

<ul>
  <li><a href="/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/names">Names</a></li>
  <li><a href="/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/dates">Dates</a></li>
  <li><a href="/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/addresses">Addresses</a></li>
  <li><a href="/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/national-insurance-number">National Insurance numbers</a></li>
 <li><a href="/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/summary-pages">Summary pages</a></li>
  <li><a href="/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/confirmation-pages">Confirmation pages</a></li>
 <li><a href="/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/help-text">Help text</a></li>
<li><a href="/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/progress-indicators">Progress indicators</a></li>

</ul>


### Process patterns
These patterns are mostly about things that you need to do (such as: ask for a start page) or ways to think about wider issues such as the relationship between parts of a transaction and user needs (such as: form structure). 
<ul>
  <li><a href="/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/form-structure">Form structure</a></li>
  <li><a href="/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/start-pages">Start pages</a></li>
   <li><a href="/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/done-pages">Done pages</a></li>
  <li><a href="/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/alpha-beta">Alpha and beta banners</a></li>

</ul>

## Get involved

These patterns are always being tested and improved. If you find a better approach to something or want to suggest a new pattern then let us know on the [design patterns wiki](https://designpatterns.hackpad.com/GOV.UK-design-patterns-0eUk1OdHvql).
